<h3 align="center">A Space Invaders inspired fixed shooter, made for CIS 1200</h3>

**Concept:**

The final HW for CIS 1200 (Programming Languages and Techniques I) is making a game in Java using Swing, so I decided to make a fixed shooter inspired by "Space Invaders". However, I didn't want to make it endless, so I decided to make it a level-based game, where the player has 10 lives to beat 15 levels, gradually increasing in difficulty. For simplicity, each level is randomly generated. I have written a CSV file with level data that contains the enemy placement ranges, speed ranges, shooting probabilities, box placement ranges, bullet types etc. In level 15, however, there is a special enemy: a tough boss.

The player has 2 types of bullets: bullets that go straight up, and ones that zig-zag (these are harder to learn, but they can be used to catch moving enemies while the player has to dodge bullets). The enemy also has 2 types: normal bullets and special bullets that can be fired from anywhere on the screen, and go directly to the player's position. For fun, in some levels I added a box that explodes and spews out bullets everywhere when shot.
